## Contributing

See open issues for contribution opportunities!

Once we get to a more stable release, we'll ensure a more formal contribution process will be in place.

> As I'm still figuring out a standardised approach to creating aura components, please reach out first if you want to contribute one! You can open a pull request, start a discussion, or you can also reach me on Twitter [@gregogun](https://twitter.com/gregogun).
